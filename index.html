     <h3>The Friendly City dances on</h3>
		<h6>Ryann Sheehy and Jessica Kronzer</h6>
         <br>
        <p>  The late evening light illuminates the high-ceilinged space, the large mirrors along the wall reflecting specks of sun. A small group huddles in the corner ready for their Kizomba class. The instruction begins and the students line up across from each other as the instructor reviews the basics. As they stumble through the steps, the instructor hypes them up, encouraging the pairs to continue as they let out nervous giggles. Latin beats pound through the studio and the dancers’ hips begin to move. </p>

        <p>The Friendly City Dance Room, located across from Court Square in downtown Harrisonburg, hosts urban dance classes every weeknight for those looking to learn something new or brush up on their moves. Phillip Fusaro, the Dance Room’s founder and owner, started the business in March of 2019 after seeing a need in the community. He said he hoped to help people form friendships in a unique way no matter their reason for walking into a dance class.</p>

        <p>“The ultimate goal of this place is not necessarily to train great dancers — though, we definitely do that,” Fusaro said. “But the primary goal is to provide people a way to connect.” </p>

       <p> Fusaro’s dance career began at the age of 9 when he started contra dance classes. In his experience, contra was a formal style requiring “coat and tails,” but he later learned it more commonly entails “straw hats, overalls and cowboy boots.” At 12 years old, Fusaso started taking ballroom dance classes and three years later he was hired by his studio as an instructor. </p>

        <p>“I've always had a joy for music and just loved grooving to it,” Fusaro said. “Even if I look super ridiculous.”</p>

        <p>While the studio offers a variety of styles of dance including kizomba, hip hop, bachata and swing dance, Fusaro said all classes feature his own “dad jokes” and lots of laughs. The classes are structured to begin with warm-ups, followed by developing footwork and forming partner connections before moving to a more advanced technique. </p>

        <p>“There's just this beautiful thing about the human body structure,” Fusaro said. “We just understand that movement, and we're able to respond to it.”</p>

        <p>Although Fusaro said he’ll never lose his love for performing, he’s found a lot of joy in teaching and running his own business. </p>

        <p>“I finally started teaching, I started building relationships with my students. I was like, ‘Oh, wow, this is actually really satisfying work,’” Fusaro said. “You get to meet people, you get to make relationships with them. You send them on their way with a smile on their face.”</p>

		<h3>JMU student gets artsy during COVID-19</h3>
		<h6>By Jessica Kronzer and Brittany Bell</h6>
             <br>
        <p>The patterned fabrics pile up in a kaleidoscope of color while resting in a bin in Moné Parker’s dorm room closet. Prevailing shades of purple are carried through the storage box. What started as volunteering at Quilt Museum in Downtown Harrisonburg has turned into <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/MoneHandCrafts" target="_blank">her own small business</a> on Etsy that sells masks, laptop and phone cases, chainmail bracelets, and sketchbooks. </p>
 
        <p>When Parker was in elementary school, she created imaginary friends and took up origami as a habit. She’d fold the colorful scraps of paper and what started as one origami kit turned into a habit of buying up papers. </p>

        <p>“I'm a crafter,” Parker said. “I love making things with my hands.”</p>

        <p>Now a senior architectural design major at JMU, Parker found herself in a similar position to when she was a kid last spring when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. She had ample free time and filled it with crafting— lots of crafting. So much crafting that she decided to sell her art to prevent the projects from turning her into a “hoarder.” She worked for three months before launching her online shop at Etsy in July to ensure she had the proper research on prices and materials. </p>

        <p>At least three times a week, Parker can be found volunteering at the Quilt Museum in Downtown Harrisonburg to fulfill a requirement of her status in <a href="https://www.jmu.edu/centscholars/" target="_blank">JMU centennial scholar program since her freshman year.</a> There, she learned to quilt and discovered the magic of the stash box, a bin full of fabric sold by the pound rather than the yard, making it cheaper. </p>

        <p>The museum provided Parker with some fabric for free. For two years, she’d come home every semester with two or three boxes stuffed with fabric. Parker prefers colorful fabrics that remind her of “sweets,” over more plain options.  </p>

       <p> Besides providing Parker with supplies, the Museum has also commissioned bookmarks from Parker and displays her business card. Museum employees have helped Parker with technical problems on her sewing machine.</p>

        <p>Parker’s favorite product to make, colorful sketchbooks, were inspired by generic sketchbooks in her classes. For Parker, sewing each product takes 5 or 6 hours and provides a break. </p>

        <p>“I just use it for relaxation when I’m over doing schoolwork,” Parker said. </p> 

        <p>What started as a way to fill free time during the lockdown, has proved to be fulfilling for Parker. One mom bought sketchbooks for her two sons; the little customers mailed Parker a postcard with their drawings to thank her. One featured a dragon and the other had three flowers.  </p>

        <p>“That almost made me cry,” Parker said. “That is why I make this stuff for people because that was amazing.”</p>

       <p> One of Parker’s favorite parts of her Etsy store products is the ability for customers to customize the products. </p>

       <p> “They just designed it and they just get what they envisioned,” Parker said. “ It's so satisfying to see something come into fruition.”</p>

        <p>While Parker has made many smaller projects for her store, Parker’s first big sewing project was a reversible tote bag. In the long term, she hopes to add a bullet planner, which is a cross between a planner and a journal, and the tote bag to her store. </p>

        <p>“It's still being creative, but you're using creativity to be productive and actually functional,” Parker said. “Not just making art to put on a wall.”</p>

		<h3>Ya like jazz? The Madison Jazz Collective</h3>
		<h6>By Jessica Kronzer and Ryann Sheehy </h6>
             <br>
    
       <p> Noah Galbreath recalled a recent gig where a woman and man sitting near the stage were visibly grooving to the smooth jazz music. He wondered if they were musicians and said he often sparks conversations with audience members who seem captivated after the show. </p>
 
       <p> “I think that kind of interaction with people is what makes it the most worth it for me,” Galbreath said.  </p>

        <p>Live music is a rare event during COVID-19, as playing instruments oftentimes requires removing one’s mask, but The Madison Jazz Collective has performed live in downtown Harrisonburg since last fall. </p>

       <p> Kyle Fauber, a senior media arts and design major, plays alto sax. Galbreath, a fifth year music education major, plays tenor sax and sometimes hops on the drums at gigs. </p>

       <p> The pair have been making music together for 8 years, since their middle and high school days. Fauber and Galbreath filled a gap at Clementine's after the previous jazz students who played downtown graduated. </p>

        <p>The two often invite their musician friends to play with them. The Madison Jazz Collective doesn’t typically rehearse, instead relying on jazz standards that they all know. </p>

       <p> “There's a big book of them that some of us carry around,” Fauber said. “If we call a tune, then everyone should know and we could just play it off the bat without even having to have music in front of us.” </p>

        <p>Some of their less musical friends think jazz music is boring when listening to a recording, but change their tune when seeing the band live. Fauber compared their jazz performances to the movie “La La Land” when Ryan Gosling’s character explains the genre to Emma Stone’s character by telling her to look at the chemistry on stage.</p>

       <p> “You can see the interactions on stage,” Fauber said. “You can see the music really being brought back to life by people of the same age.”</p>

        <p>Galbreath is a student teacher with middle schoolers and said his students are often fascinated by the sounds different instruments make. He said the audience at Clementine's often has a similar reaction when hearing live music. </p>

        <p>“You actually hear saxophones and trumpets and stuff in tons of pop music, but it's mixed in this way where it's not the forefront,” Galbreath said. “I think some of it is like interacting with instruments you didn't even really think could be played that way.”</p>

       <p> Both Fauber and Galbreath hope to keep jazz in their lives after graduating. Fauber said he loves the energy and vibe with the audience at Clementine.</p> 

       <p> “Promoting jazz music and just having a good time, seeing someone down there who's really into it,” Fauber said. “One person can change the whole show.” </p>

        <h3>Welcome to the Wayne</h3>
		<h6>By Jessica Kronzer and Brittany Bell</h6>
        <br>
        <p> The original stained glass window from 1926 illuminates the street of downtown, grabbing the attention of local theatre lovers looking for a show. Old buildings became money pits and eventually unimportant to the city, including the theatre. Ever since reopening almost 90 years later, the Wayne Theatre has revitalized the downtown scene and art culture of Waynesboro. </p>

       <p> Tracy Straight, the theatre’s executive director, took on the project of restoring the Wayne in 1998 as a way of giving a gift back to the community. </p>

        <p>“We just started gathering people, we called ourselves the Friends of the Wayne, and
        had little barbecues at different people's homes and invited people just to come and talk about it,” Straight said. “And that's how it all started.”</p> 

        <p>In 2000, Straight and the volunteers formed the Wayne Theatre Alliance to prevent the building from being demolished. The group incorporated as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in 2002 and that’s when donations started pouring in. They raised $4 million, the largest amount a nonprofit has ever raised in Waynesboro. </p>

        <p>“We knew this project was going to take more funding than what we could raise as volunteers,” Straight said. “With this assistance and gathering more people, we sought out historic tax credits and were one of the first projects in the United States to do New Market Tax Credit.”</p>

        <p>The Wanye began to expand its properties by acquiring a storefront in 2012 and then transforming it into a small venue with a thrust stage that could host 120 people.</p>

        <p>“It was a way for us to really dip our toes more into providing arts for people and something to give people a reason to come back downtown,” said Straight. “We called it the Gateway, because it was the gateway to finally opening the Wayne Theatre.”</p>

        <p>On March 1, 2016 the Wayne Theatre officially reopened, and now offers a wide variety of performances, film showings and classes.The theatre offers a minimum of 10 free events a month.</p>

        <p>“We just have a jar at the front that says: pay what you will,” Straight said.  Some people put something into a jar, some don’t, but they are still just as welcome,” Straight said.</p>

        <p>Now, the Wayne is more established, and Straight sees a window of opportunity to expand the Wayne’s presence in the coming years. The theatre is planning an extension called ‘The Wayne Campus’ or ‘The Hillside’  marking the start of their next capital campaign. The property, by Harvest Church, will become the Wayne’s by the end of the month and will host classes and meetings.</p>

        <p>“Then we have the hilltop house, which takes us to the end of the block,” Straight said.“In the future that'd be a wonderful place for apartments, boutiques, hotels, a place where we bring in artists.” </p>

        <p>Despite the theatre temporarily shutting its doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Straight never gave up on her goal of providing the Wayne experience. Straight and her staff were able to maintain their connection with the community by offering their weekly events in a virtual atmosphere. Fortunately, the Wayne will be offering virtual and in-person opportunities for their upcoming production of The Wizard of Oz.</p>

        <p>“I just could not be more proud of them, and their talent and their work,” Straight said. “I'm thankful that we are an outlet or a venue or another space where they can share their time and their talents and their art form.”</p>

                 <figcaption>To accommodate the pandemic, The Wayne Theatre produced The Wizard of Oz with a twist; the show offers both in-person and virtual viewing experiences. The acting staff has been limited to reduce covid risk, which creates a challenge solved by putting on the production in a unique way. </figcaption>

            <p style="text-align: center">The restrictions that came with the COVID-19 pandemic stunted many performances and appeared to halt artists around the world. However, in the small city of Harrisonburg, Virginia, there are many creatives who chose to continue creating art. These four artists and groups from the Shenandoah Valley demonstrate the growth and adaptation it takes to keep art alive in seemingly dark times. As you explore these pages, you can read, watch and listen to their stories as they inspire creativity and perseverance in us all. </p>
